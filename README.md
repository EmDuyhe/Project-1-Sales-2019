# Project-1-Sales-2019
This project aims to practice four libraries in Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Use four libraries to analyze the Sales Data in 2019. <br>
All of the files I downloaded from KeithGalli. https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks <br>
In this Project, I used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn frequently. Although NumPy, I use it less, I sometimes use AI for help. 
<br>
First 17 questions, you'll practice to group, analyze, and recognize methods. 
From questions 18 to 25, you'll practice making a graph from easy to hard. And, write the Insight for the graph.
<br>
Because this is the first Project on the road to becoming a Data Analyst, maybe I will have some failures.  <br>
And thank you for reading....
